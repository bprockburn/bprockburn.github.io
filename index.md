## About Me

![Profile](assets/images/picture.JPG)

Hello!

I'm Brianna Rockburn, a first year Data Science student at Michigan Technological University.

My current goals is to graduate MTU with a bachelor's in Data Science and pursue a full-time job doing data governance and ethics.

When not heading to class or working on course work, I like reading, crochet, and writing.
